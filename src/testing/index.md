At dxw we think about accessibility when we’re researching, designing and developing services. This means that we test that our service is as accessible as possible throughout the design and development process.

We aim to:

* Perform accessibility reviews when designing
* Use [automated testing tools](./automated-testing) during development
* [Review our work](./what-to-test#when-to-test) with accessibility in mind
* Test our services manually and perform accessibility audits

## Guides
