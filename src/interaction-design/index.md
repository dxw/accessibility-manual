At dxw we think about accessibility when weâ€™re researching, designing and developing services. 

Accessible services are easier for everyone to use. Our design team designs accessible services and tests for accessibility throughout service development.

This means we think about

* what users see - do they have sight loss or colour blindness? What size screen do they use?
* the technology users use - do they use a screen reader, special software or an [alternative input device](https://business.scope.org.uk/article/assistive-technology-devices-definitions-how-disabled-people-use-the-web)?
* how users think - do they struggle to remember things? Are they neurodivergent?
* how users behave - are they outdoors in bright sunshine? Do they have a slow connection?
