Designs that are accessible to people with visual impairments not only improve their user experience, but also benefit a wider audience. A visually accessible design ensures that information and functionality are clearly presented and easy to understand for everyone, regardless of their visual ability. Emphasising accessibility in design helps to create a more inclusive and user-friendly digital environment.

It's advised to integrate accessibility considerations in the design phase and to perform accessibility evaluations consistently throughout both the design and development stages.
