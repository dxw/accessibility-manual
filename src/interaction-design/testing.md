Do not use colour as the only visual means of providing information. This excludes users with certain visual impairments, people who use text or braille displays and users with low-colour or monochrome displays.  

## Example

We want to show the outcome of a user’s application. This option does so only using colour.

![Alt= Outcome of user’s applications. Under the heading status there is a red bar for application one and a green bar for application two. ](/assets/images/colours-only-coloured.png)

This is how this visual would appear to someone with protanopia, the most common form of colour blindness

![Alt=Outcome of user’s applications. Under the status heading there is an olive green bar against application one with a slightly darker green bar under application two. ](/assets/images/colours-only-bnw.png)

You can use colour in your designs but you must add another way to signify meaning so that someone who cannot perceive colour can still understand the information. 

![Alt=Outcome of user’s applications. Under the status heading there is a red bar with the word ‘failed’ in red type against application one. There is a green bar with ‘succeed’ in green type under application two. ](/assets/images/colours-and-text-coloured.png)
