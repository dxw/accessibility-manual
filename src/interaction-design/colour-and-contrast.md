All colour combinations must have sufficient contrast. 

* headings must have a colour contrast of at least 3:1
* body text must have a colour contrast of at least 4:5:1
* very high contrast, like pure black text on a white background, can be [hard to read and cause eye strain](https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/)
* avoid placing text over images or textured background - if you must place a solid or a transparent dark background behind the text (assuming the text is in white or other light colours) 

Use tools to check colour combinations

* [WebAimâ€™s contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) tells you if your combinations pass or fail the [web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) at AA and AAA
* [Who can use](https://www.whocanuse.com/) shows how your combinations look to people with certain eye conditions and in certain light settings
* [Accessible colours](https://accessible-colors.com/) checks your contrasts and suggests alternate text or background colours that will pass WCAG AA and AAA
