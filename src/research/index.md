As user researchers at dxw, we must:

* do research to help teams understand and act on the accessibility needs of people who might use, operate and be affected by a service
* do research in an inclusive and accessible way, so that everyone who needs to can participate

This guide covers the seven parts of our user research workflow.  For each part, it summarises the issues we consider and provides links to relevant guidance. Unless indicated, the guidance is in the User research section of the dxw Playbook.

## Take part in project inception

During project inception we look out for aspects of a service that might be a barrier or benefit for people with accessibility needs, and which groups of people might be affected.

As we identify and describe the groups of people who might use, operate and be affected by a service, we are careful to use inclusive language.

## Create and share research plans

When planning our research we make sure that our research questions consider potential barriers in the service, and the accessibility needs of people who are likely to use, operate and be affected by the service. 

We consider carefully which groups of people with accessibility needs we will want to research with, to make sure that we understand their needs and can test the accessibility of all parts of the service. We know that we cannot do research with people with every possible accessibility need, so we may need to prioritise people who are likely to be impacted the most.

As we choose what research activities we might do, we consider carefully how to make those activities inclusive and accessible.

And this is where we consider the ethical and safety implications of our research. We may be discussing people’s experience of discrimination with existing services. Or visiting people in their homes so they can use their own assistive technology setup.

## Recruit people for research

We make sure that our recruitment practices are inclusive and accessible, so we don’t exclude groups such as disabled people, and people with other protected characteristics.

We take care to build relationships with underrepresented groups who may not immediately trust us. Often starting with relevant membership bodies and community organisations.

When we describe participant groups, and when we communicate with groups and individual participants, we take care to use inclusive language.

## Do research activities

As we do our research activities, we make sure they are inclusive and accessible for our participants and our colleagues. This is particularly important when we are researching accessibility needs with disabled participants.

## Analyse research and produce findings

As we do our analysis, we make sure that we do it in a way that is inclusive and accessible for our colleagues.

## Create and share outputs

When we create and share outputs we make sure that the reports, presentations and other materials we produce are inclusive and accessible. We use accessible formats, inclusive words, and simple, clear, everyday language.

We also consider carefully what quotes, photos and video clips we use to illustrate our findings and recommendations. This is particularly important when participants have shared past experiences or details about themselves that they want to keep private. Or when photos and video clips show things that a participant would not want shared.

## Take care of research data

We take care of the research data we collect. This is particularly important when researching accessibility needs. Participants may have shared past experiences or details about themselves that they want to keep private.
