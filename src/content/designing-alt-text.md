All non-text content must have a text alternative. This alternative should properly describe the element so as not to exclude people who cannot access the visual. 

## Alt text for images

Alternative text for images should

* be short and descriptive
* convey the same message to the user that the image would
* not start with the phrase ‘an image of’, or ‘a photo of’ - this is already provided by the screen reader
* include punctuation, especially a full-stop at the end – this helps the screen reader take appropriate pauses
* be filled with a blank (“”) if the image is purely decorative and doesn’t provide any information - this [decision tree can help you decide if alt text is necessary](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)

## Alt text for data visualisation

It can be difficult to explain the meaning of graphs, charts and other data visualisation using short alt text. 



Try using [Amy Cesal’s model for adding alt text to data visualisation](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81):

Alt = \[chart type of type of data where reason for including data]



For example: alt= Pie chart of school admission data from the Department of Education for the year 2022 where 43% of children did not get their preferred choice]



Your alternative text should include a link to the data source.



Complex data visualisations should include a simple explanation of the data for all users in addition to alt text.

## Text alternatives for video content

Video content should include

* subtitles
* a transcript, including [descriptions to provide context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcripts/#descriptive)
* [audio description](https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/digital-communication/accessible-communications/adding-an-audio-description-to-your-videos/) or an alternative video with audio description



You don’t have to provide subtitles, transcripts or audio descriptions if you are providing the video as a text alternative. 

## Text alternatives for audio content

Provide a descriptive transcript for audio-only content like podcasts.
