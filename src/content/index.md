At dxw we think about accessibility when we’re researching, designing and developing services. 

We design content in a way that makes it easy for the user to:
- find the information they need
- understand the information they find
- put the information they find into action, where necessary

Designing accessible content means:
- creating content that everyone can understand and use
- writing in simple, clear everyday language that meets the user’s needs
- breaking up chunks of text
- using clear headings to help people find what they need
- making sure any non-text content has a clear text alternative

Designing accessible content is an important part of accessibility. Testing tools will miss many of the accessibility issues in your content, so we have to make sure we spot and correct any issues.
