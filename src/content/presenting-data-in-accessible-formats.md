Some content is best presented in tables, charts or data visualisations. You need to make sure all users can access this information. 

## Making tables accessible

Only use tables to present data in a logical way. Do not use tables as a layout tool. 



Screen readers can interpret table as long as they use the correct markup:

* use a header row to explain what type of data is in each column
* use the <caption> element to help users understand what the table is
* keep the table simple – do not split or merge cells
* avoid empty cells – this can trick a screen reader into thinking there is no more data to read
* add the table using code – do not just paste in a screenshot



Follow the [Web Accessibility Initiative’s advice on making tables accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/).

## Making charts and graphs accessible

Users with visual impairments can find it difficult to interpret graphs, especially if these rely on colour to show meaning. 



All users can find charts and graphs inaccessible if they are not complex and are not accompanied by a clear narrative. 



You can make charts and graphs more accessible if you

* check there is sufficient contrast between all colours used in a graph and the background colour
* use pattern with colour to impart meaning
* write alternative text that describes the chart
* include a simple explanation of the data in the body of the page
* provide the chart or graph data in a table
