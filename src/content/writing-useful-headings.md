Headings are an important part of your page structure. Headings help:

* users scan content and decide whether to read further
* screen readers navigate your page
* search engines index your content and decide whether to include it in results

When you are writing headings, you should:

* put the most important information at the start of the heading – ‘Applying for a home’, not ‘How to apply for a home’
* use clear, descriptive language
* use sentence-case – only capitalising the first letter and any proper nouns
* use code, not formatting, to mark headings
* put headings in a logical sequence
* avoid [using questions as headings](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/25/faqs-why-we-dont-have-them/)
* check if your headings work as a summary of the page’s contents

## Choosing page titles

Your page title should 

* be short and descriptive
* not duplicate other page titles on your site
* describe the purpose of a page
* make sense when read out of context, for example in a sitemap
* use the page title element and <h1> tag

## Applying heading structure

Headings must follow a logical structure. The headings on a webpage follow a nested order:

* use Heading 1 (<h1>) for the page title
* use Heading 2 (<h2> for subheadings
* use Heading 3 (<h3>) for any subheadings within H2 content 
* only use further heading tags (<h4>, <h5>, <h6>) if nesting content further

You can only skip headings if moving up the order – for example, you can move from <h4> to <h2> but you cannot move from <h2> to <h4>
