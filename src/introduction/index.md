At dxw, our [mission](https://playbook.dxw.com/about-us/our-mission-values-and-principles/#our-mission) is to build services
that fit seamlessly into user's lives, and that make public services
usable and accessible to all – especially those most in need.

To achieve that mission, we must create services that work well for [people with accessibility needs](#what-we-mean-by-people-with-accessibility-needs).

This guide explains:
* what we mean by concepts like [accessibility needs](#what-we-mean-by-people-with-accessibility-needs), [disability](#what-we-mean-by-disability) and [assistive technology](#what-we-mean-by-assistive-technology)
* the different [conceptual models of disability](#conceptual-models-of-disability)

## What we mean by people with accessibility needs
People with accessibility needs are people that have specific needs, at this point in their life, when accessing and 
using products and services.

They may be the members of the public who directly use a service, people helping others to use a service, public servants
supporting and operating services, or colleagues working along side us to create those services.

Some will use assistive products to maintain or perform activities of daily living, like accessing a computer, eating or 
communicating.

Accessibility needs can be a result of:

* **disability** - cognitive, visual, auditory and movement disabilities, like learning disabilities, blindness,
  deafness/Deafness or arthritis
* **illness/disease/condition** - like long covid, Parkinson’s disease or menopause.
* **situational restrictions/inequity** - like not having a smartphone,
  [not having an internet connection](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/articles/exploringtheuksdigitaldivide/2019-03-04)
  or not having sufficient digital confidence to perform some tasks.  

When we are working to the [Service Standard](/introduction/obligations#the-service-standard),
we must do [research with people with accessibility needs](/research/).

## What we mean by disability
Disability is one word attempting to describe lots of different experiences and stories.

The [World Health Organisation](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/classification/icf/icfbeginnersguide.pdf)
states that disability is an umbrella term covering impairments, activity limitations
and participation restrictions:
* **impairments** are a disruption/difference in body function and/or structure
* **activity limitations** are difficulties faced when trying to do a task or action
* **participation restrictions** are challenges experienced when involved in life situations

About 15% of the human population has a disability
([WeThe15](https://www.wethe15.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjw3ueiBhBmEiwA4BhspLqd1n_QXa2rqEQp-PnT04IVYx2A13O8VvrRddNMBoQmK-Wf5ES7SBoCWVkQAvD_BwE)).
That is 1.2 billion of people in the world that have a physical, visual, hearing and/or cognitive disability.
Often, people will experience more than one disability at any given time and their experience will be compounded by 
chronic illnesses, mental health problems and other protected characteristics, like gender. 

Disability is not static, and cannot be separated from human development
([disability creation process](https://sjdr.se/articles/10.16993/sjdr.62#3-fundamentals-of-the-dcp)). It is
individually and culturally defined and subjected to power dynamics.

Disability can be experienced short term (for example, someone that just had an eye surgery and is in recovery) or
long term, and sometimes can be progressive (getting worse with time). So we must design products and services that 
support changing access needs.

The [Human Rights Act and Equality Act](/introduction/obligations#human-rights-act-and-equality-act) require us
to create services that work well for people with disabilities, and people with other protected characteristics.

## What we mean by assistive technology
Assistive technologies are products, systems and services that help people with accessibility needs to successfully access and
use other products and services. Helping them to maintain or perform activities of daily living, to have independent, healthy and
dignified lives, and participate in their communities.

3.5 billion people will need assistive technology by 2050 globally. Unfortunately, access to assistive products is not equitable
and in some countries, only 3% of people have access to assistive products
([assistive technology key facts](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/assistive-technology)).

Assistive technology is used not only by people with disabilities. All people with accessibility needs may use assistive technology
(if they have access to it and know how to use it).

When we are working to the [Service Standard](/introduction/obligations#the-service-standard),
we must [test our services with common assistive technologies](/development/).

## Conceptual models of disability
The way we think about disability determines how we define disability, how we understand the impact of disability and how
we design products and services for people with disabilities.

### Medical model
This model promotes the idea that disability is caused by individual impairments and that disabled people are a collection of
deficits, a minority and that they need to be diagnosed, cured, controlled and prevented. This model is flawed because it does
not include non-medical aspects of disability, such as lived experiences, environment, society and intersectionality. For example,
some people see disability as their identity and would not seek a cure.

### Social model
This model promotes the idea that society has a role in exacerbating or ameliorating the challenges faced by disabled people. For
example, a socially hostile and discriminatory environment could be much more disabling than any individual disability. This model
aims at reducing discrimination and injustice towards disabled people and it has been useful at supporting the development of
public policies. This model is flawed because it does not include the individual disability (by focusing only on the disabling
society) thus excluding impairments and disability identity.

### Biopsychosocial model
This model promotes the idea that disability is a combination of physical, emotional and environmental experiences. This model
underpins the International Classification of Functioning, endorsed by the World Health Organisation. This model is flawed
because it promotes an overly normative understanding of what is a ‘normal functioning body’.

### Human rights model
The [United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-Persons-with-disabilities.html)
promotes the idea that human interactions, attitudinal barriers and environmental barriers hinder the full and effective
participation in society, and this results in disability.

UNCRPD aims to ensure that people with disabilities have the same cultural, social, economic, political and civil
rights as non-disabled.

UNCRPD shifts disability conceptualization from a social welfare and medical concern to a human rights
issue that admits that society’s barriers and prejudices are disabling. The aim of this model is to encourage disability policy.
