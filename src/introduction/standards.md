This guide identifies and describes the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and other standards we may need to comply with.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) are developed by the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). They explain how to make web content more accessible to disabled people.

Public services must achieve WCAG 2.2 level AA as part of
[meeting government accessibility requirements](/introduction/obligations.md#public-sector-bodies-accessibility-regulations).
So we expect all the web pages and web applications we create to meet those requirements.

If youâ€™re new to WCAG, [Understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag)
in the GOV.UK Service Manual might be a good place to start.

## The Accessible Information Standard

When working with the NHS and organisations that provide adult care, we may also need to comply with the
[Accessible Information Standard](https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/equality/equality-hub/patient-equalities-programme/equality-frameworks-and-information-standards/accessibleinfo/).

This standard sets out an approach to the information and communication support needs of people with a
disability, impairment or sensory loss.
