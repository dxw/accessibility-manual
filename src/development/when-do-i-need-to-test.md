Begin with thinking about accessibility from the start of a project to reduce unexpected delays and difficulties typically experienced when testing for accessibility retrospectively. 

Run your own accessibility tests regularly throughout development to try to identify accessibility barriers and challenges early on.

For a public beta or production release, you must get an accessibility audit and fix any issues it highlights before anything is released to the public. Getting an accessibility expert to do the audit is necessary. 

Within dxw, accessibility experts include:
