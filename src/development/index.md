At dxw we think about accessibility when weâ€™re researching, designing and developing services. 

Accessible services are easier for everyone to use. Our developers write accessible code and test for accessibility throughout service design and development. 

This means we think about

* what users see - do they have sight loss or colour blindness? What size screen do they use?
* the technology users use- do they use a screen reader, special software or an [alternative input device](https://business.scope.org.uk/article/assistive-technology-devices-definitions-how-disabled-people-use-the-web)?
* how users think - do they struggle to remember things? Are they neurodivergent?
* how users behave - are they outdoors in bright sunshine? Do they have a slow connection?
