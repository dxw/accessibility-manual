At dxw we think about accessibility when we’re researching, designing and developing services. 

Accessible services are easier for everyone to use. Our developers write accessible code and test for accessibility throughout service design and development.  

The way we write code influences how [assistive technologies](./introduction#what-we-mean-by-assistive-technology) interpret pages.  

We should:

- [use the GOV.UK Design System](./design-systems) (if appropriate for the service)
- [create structure for our pages using semantic HTML](./creating-structure-with-html)
- [use appropriate HTML tags for elements](./creating-structure-with-html#using-the-right-html-tags)
- [describe visual content](./videos-and-images)
- [provide accessible names for interactive elements](./naming-interactive-elements)
- [provide visual feedback](./providing-visual-feedback)
- [provide navigation shortcuts](./navigation-shortcuts-and-skip-links)
