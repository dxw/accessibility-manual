When building digital services which meet the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), refer to the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) for common components which have been extensively tested by users with different accessibility needs. If a Design System component doesn’t exist for what you need, use the appropriate HTML element.

Using the GOV.UK Design System or any other library does not guarantee an accessible end product. You should always check the guidance when using components or patterns from these libraries. Check GitHub for ongoing conversations about components and patterns and share your findings.

[Test the code and application](/testing) in the same way you would when writing code from scratch.
