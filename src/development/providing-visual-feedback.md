Users need to know where they are on a page. This can be more difficult for people using a keyboard, screen reader or speech recognition tool to navigate a site.

When adding custom styles to interactive elements using CSS, makes sure to:

- include focus, active and hover styles
- use the browser default if your design system does not provide a style.
