For vision impaired users, the ability to navigate pages by jumping over repeated sections and other page content is important for quick and easy access to different parts of a page.

## Skip links

Whenever you have repetitive content on a page, then make sure to include a skip link above it. Typically, users want to bypass the navigation menu, so adding a skip link above this that navigates to the main tag of the page is the best approach that's commonly implemented.
