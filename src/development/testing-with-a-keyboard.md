## Check for anything interactive

When testing with a keyboard it's important to check for consistency and sufficient visibility of focus states on all interactive components of a page.

Interactive components to test include:

* Links
* Form fields, such as inputs, checkboxes, dropdown (selects)
* Buttons
* Media play controls

## How to test

The main keys to use for testing with a keyboard include \`tab\` to move between interactive components, and the \`enter\` or \`spacebar\` key to trigger them. You may also need to test some elements, such as dropdown option fields, using the arrow keys.
