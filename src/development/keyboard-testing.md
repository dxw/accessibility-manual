## Check for anything interactive

When testing with a keyboard check that:

* all interactive components on a page are consistent
* the focus state is sufficiently visible for all components 

Test all interactive components, including:

* links
* form fields, such as inputs, checkboxes, dropdown (selects)
* buttons
* media play controls

## How to test

Use the `tab` key to move between interactive components. 

Use the `enter` key or spacebar to trigger components. 

You may need to use the arrow keys to test some elements, such as dropdown option fields.
