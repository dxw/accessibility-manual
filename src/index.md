title: Accessibility at dxw
---

At dxw, our [mission](https://playbook.dxw.com/about-us/our-mission-values-and-principles/#our-mission) is to build services that fit seamlessly into user’s lives, and that make public services usable and accessible to all – especially those most in need.

To achieve that mission, we must create services that work well for
[people with accessibility needs](/introduction/#what-we-mean-by-people-with-accessibility-needs).

We know that accessibility needs vary widely, and can conflict. So designing and building accessible public services needs careful thought and sometimes difficult decisions.

The guides in this accessibility manual help us all take a consistent and effective approach to accessibility.

## Understanding accessibility

Our [guide to understanding accessibility](/introduction/) explains terms like accessibility needs, disability, assistive technology, and the different ways of thinking about disability.

  public sector services and content, and explains the obligations they place on us
* explains terms like [reasonable adjustments](/introduction/obligations/#reasonable-adjustments) and
