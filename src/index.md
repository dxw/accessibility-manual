We create public services that improve lives through embedding accessibility and inclusive design practices into the way we work. 

Our Accessibility Manual is for the benefit of everyone working here or with us, including any current or potential client.

## What this manual provides:

* Guidance on how each team member can contribute to the accessibility of a service, or way of working
* How to interpret and adhere to laws, regulations, and guidelines focused on making your service inclusive and accessible
* Understanding on how the needs of users relate to good accessibility practise
