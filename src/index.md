title: Accessibility at dxw
---
At dxw, we believe that everything we create for the web should be as easy to use as possible so that no one is excluded from using a website because of their disability.

## Web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG)

WCAG is a set of [guidelines for building accessible services.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) The law says that all online public services must meet WCAG 2.1 level AA. 

## Designing for everyone

There are 16 million disabled people in the UK. But everyone experiences disability in some form at some stage that interferes with their ability to use online services.

Disability can be permanent, temporary or related to your situation:

* having dyslexia means you struggle with large blocks of text
* a broken hand means you struggle to use your mouse
* bright sunshine means you struggle to see your screen

When we’re designing services, we think about

* what users see - do they have sight loss or colour blindness? What size screen do they use?
* the technology users use- do they use a screen reader, special software or an [alternative input device](https://business.scope.org.uk/article/assistive-technology-devices-definitions-how-disabled-people-use-the-web)?
* how users think - do they struggle to remember things? Are they neurodivergent?
* how users behave - are they outdoors in bright sunshine? Do they have a slow internet connection?
